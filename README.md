CUDA Flocking Simulation üê† ü¶©
=============================
_Source: University of Pennsylvania, [CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture](https://cis565-fall-2021.github.io/)_

A CUDA and C++ implementation of the famous [Raynolds Boids flocking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). The implementation is further optimized with a uniform and coherent grid search, which restrict the search radius of each boid and organize boid data such that they can be conveniently accessed (contiguous in memory).

## Reflections ü§î

Reasons for decreasing FPS with increasing # of boids:
- More boid neighbors to check and process
- Larger data structures = high cost of "ping-pong" method and data management

Reason for decreasing FPS with block size < 128:
- Smaller block sizes results in more blocks assigned to cores, which can lead to higher cost to manage

Reason for decreasing FPS with block size > 128:
- Larger block sizes causes higher latency because they require the SM assigned to use more warp cycles (an SM runs 8 threads in a cycle; high block sizes = more threads per block = more warp cycles per block)
